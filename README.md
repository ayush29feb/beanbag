### Bean Bag App
  - Bean Bag is simple app that will text us notifying to deliver you a beanbag at Odegaard Library (UW Seattle) in the middle of the night for you to sleep on.

### The Story
  - I am nocturnal, and at least 3 nights a week I don't spend the night in my dorm room.
  - I wished, only if I could had a bean bag at the Odegaard Library to sleep on.
  - So, at the end of the Codeday Spring 2015, when my project fell apart, I decided to make 'Bean Bag' in the last 2 hours
